`hypermutR` was originally developed as a replacement for the `removeHypermutatedSequences.R` script in the hiv-founder-id pipeline which is hosted at [Founder Pipeline](https://github.com/pedlefsen/hiv-founder-id).

This script is (hopefully was by the time you read this) called from the `identify-founders.pl` script using perl's backtick notation. Information was passed to the `removeHypermutatedSequences.R` script by setting environment variables. Information was passed back to the `identify-founders.pl` script by printing to STDOUT and by saving results in a file whose name is specified by one of the environment variables.

The intended way to use `hypermutR` is either via the hypermutR.R script included in the package's inst directory or by importing the package in an R session and calling the `remove_hypermut` function.

To ease integration of `hypermutR` into the hiv-founder-id pipeline, a removeHypermutatedSequences.R script is included in the inst folder of the package. This script can be called using the call that was originally included in the `identify-founders.pl` script.

Environment variables included in the `identify-founders.pl` call:

* `removeHypermutatedSequences_fixWith`
* `removeHypermutatedSequences_fixInsteadOfRemove`
* `removeHypermutatedSequences_pValueThreshold`
* `removeHypermutatedSequences_inputFilename`
* `removeHypermutatedSequences_outputDir`

Output expected by `identify-founders.pl` from `removeHypermutatedSequences.R`.

* Number of hypermutated sequences printed to STDOUT.
* Fasta file written out by `ape::write.dna` to `removeHypermutatedSequences_outputDir/removeHypermutatedSequences_inputFilename` with the call `write.dna( out.fasta, out.fasta.file, format = "fasta", colsep = "", indent = 0, blocksep = 0, colw = 72 )`
